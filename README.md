# SDLS - Summary of Changes in Light Scattering Simulation (DLS package)
[The text below comes from Appendix to H. Jethva et al., "Ground-based MFRSR UV-Vis spectral retrievals of Saharan dust absorption at Izaña Observatory", Egusphere 2025, 4890, doi: https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2025-4890]

Here, we summarize the simplifications implemented in the streamlined, swift DLS package (SDLS). DLS (Dubovik
et al., 2006) is FORTRAN code that calculates radiative parameters (extinction and absorption coefficients, and the
phase matrix) for light scattering by a group of randomly oriented spheroids, based on their optical (real n and
imaginary k parts of the refractive index) and geometric (size r and aspect ratio ε distributions, D(r) and D(ε),
respectively) parameters, and the particle concentration.
